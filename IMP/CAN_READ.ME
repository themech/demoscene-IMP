
  omen/Dimension presents the shitty 4kB called IMP.

  F..., why is it so hard to write that read-stuff. I dunno what kind
of mess put here ......... Maybe this way :

1 ) Getting started (???)
  When now I'm thinking about that code, I'd do so many things differently.
But who cares anyway. It's just 4kB, strange that you've got that stuff :).
Maybe in some bigger prods we'll put really good pieces of code. I just
hope you'll hear about us again.....

2 ) Technical stuff :
- himem.sys required
- v86 mode not supprted, so don't run emm386.exe
- vesa 2.0 ( linear frame buffer )
- about 6MB RAM (sorry, life is brutal :) )
- coprocessor
- written'n'tested( let's say so ) on 200MMX
- don't run it under shit'95 and others, pure dos is perfect

3 ) Some other mess
- won't be cheating you - this intro is a little bit lame, but I just wanted
 to release something. It was written during one weekend (18-19.07.1998).
 It's one of the first products ( I think ) of Dimention, so you'd crush it
 anyway :)
- maybe there are too many parts in it, but I didn't want to show U only 2
  effects, 100 seconds each
